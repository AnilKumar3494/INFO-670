## My Candy Shop

Welcome to My Candy Shop, an online store where you can buy your favorite candies and chocolates. This app serves both vendors and customers, allowing them to sell and purchase items easily. Currently, the focus is on chocolates and candies, but the selection can expand to include any desired items in the future.

### Data Format and Administration

The app utilizes an array format to display items. This means that administrators can easily add new products by simply updating this array. In the future, we plan to implement an Admin Panel that will allow admins to add items directly without needing to access the code.
